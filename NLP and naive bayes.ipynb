I do get your distinction between\\nmotivate and allow, and I do agree that if a flavour of theism 'allows'\\natoricities, then that's an indictment of that theism.  But it rather\\ndepends on what the 'certain circumstances' are.  When you talk about\\nChristianity, or Islam, then at least your claims can be understood.\\nIt's when people go to a general statement about theism that it falls\\napart.

And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|> #being religiously motivated.\\n#|> \\n#|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|> he was the devil incarnate?

If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \"religion did this\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?

Fordham) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission from an HIV-positive surgeon to  patient is \\nextremely low, provided that the surgeon strictly  adheres to universal \\ninfection control procedures, write C.  Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.

I also happen to believe that that something\\n#|> else will work no less well without religion - any easy Them/Us will\\n#|> do.\\n#\\n#And what does religion supply, if not an easy Them/Us?\\n\\nNot necessarily.  \"Love thy neighbour\" does not supply a them/us - it\\ndemolishes it.  And my definition of religion is broader than my\\ndefinition of theism, as I have explained.\\n#\\n#|> #By insisting that even the murder of four labourers, chosen because\\n#|> #they were catholics, and who had nothing to do with the IRA, by \\n#|> #Protestant extremists, is *not* religously motivated, I think what \\n#|> #you are saying is that you simply will not accept *any* murder as \\n#|> #being religiously motivated.\\n#|> \\n#|> No.  What about that guy who cut off someone's head because he believed \\n#|> he was the devil incarnate?  That was religously motivated.\\n#\\n#What about the Protestant extremists who killed four Catholic \\n#labourers?     That *wasn't* religiously motivated?\\n\\nNot in my opinion.  If they were doing it because of some obscure\\npoint of theology, then yes.  But since all protestants don't do this\\n(nor do they elect extremists to do it for them), it's just too broad\\ntoo say \"religion did this\".  I'm saying that the causes are far more\\ncomplex than that - take away the religious element, and you'd still\\nhave the powerful motives of revenge and misguided patriotism.  You\\nknow, when most Catholics and Protestants worldwide say 'stop the \\nkilling', one might listen to that, especially when you claim not\\nto read minds.\\n#\\n#\\n#|> Also, the murders ensuing from the fatwa on Mr. Rushdie, the Inquisitions,\\n#|> and the many religous wars.\\n#\\n#What's so special about these exceptions?    Isn't this all just a\\n#grab-bag of ad-hoc excuses for not considering some other murders\\n#to be religiously motivated?    What's the general principle behind\\n#all this?\\n\\nThe general principle is that it's fairly clear (to me, at least) that\\nreligion is the primary motivator (enabler, whatever) of these.  It's\\nnot nearly so obvious what's going on when one looks at NI, apart\\nfrom violence of course.\\n#\\n#|> #It's not an abstract \"argument\".   Northern Irish Protestants say\\n#|> #\"We don't want to be absorbed into am officially Catholic country.\"\\n#|> #\\n#|> #Now what are we supposed to do?   Are we supposed to reply \"No,\\n#|> #that's only what you think you don't want.   Mr O'Dwyer assures us\\n#|> #that no matter what you say you want, you really want something \\n#|> #else?\"\\n#|> \\n#|> You think the Unionists wouldn't mind being absorbed into a non-Catholic \\n#|> country (other than the UK of course)?   It's a terrible thing to lose\\n#|> a mind.   Maybe the word \"country\" is there for more than just kicks.\\n#|> I certainly don't believe that the Unionists are in it for God - I think\\n#|> they wish to maintain their position of privilege.\\n#\\n#I'm still listening to what they say, and you are still telling us \\n#your version of what they think.   You read minds, and I don't.\\n\\nYou've speculated on my motives often enough, and you don't take\\nmy statements of my own beliefs at face value - therefore your claim \\nnot to read minds has no credibility with me, sorry.   I also note that \\nyou fail to answer my question.  It just looks to me very much like\\nyou have an axe to grind - especially as you are indeed ignoring what \\nmost Protestants say - which is @stop the killing\".  The people you\\nrefer to are properly described as Unionists, not Protestants.\\n#\\n#As for their position of privilege, what is that if not religion-\\n#based?\\n\\nIt is based on politics, bigotry, and heartless extremism.  None of these\\nthings are synonymous with religion, though there is certainly some\\noverlap.\\n\\n\\n-- \\nFrank O'Dwyer                                  'I'm not hatching That'\\nodwyer@sse.ie

Fordham von Reyn et al. of the \\nDartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H.  The researchers contacted \\n2,317 former patients on whom an HIV-positive orthopedic surgeon performed \\ninvasive  procedures between January 1, 1978 and June 30, 1992.  The  \\northopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after  testing positive \\nfor HIV.  A total of 1,174 former patients  underwent HIV testing, \\nrepresenting 50.7 percent of patients on  whom the orthopedic surgeon \\nperformed invasive procedures during  the 13.5-year period.  Patients were \\ntested from each year and  from each category of invasive procedure.  All \\npatients were  found to be negative for HIV by enzyme-linked-immunosorbent  \\nassay.  Two former patients reported known HIV infection prior to surgery.  \\nThe examination of AIDS case registries and vital  records neglected to detect \\ncases of HIV infection among former  surgical patients.  The estimated cost of \\nthe initial patient  notification and testing was $158,000, with the single \\nmost  expensive activity being counseling and testing.  This accounted  for 37 \\npercent of the total expense.  The patient notification  and testing were \\nconducted while maintaining the confidentiality  of the orthopedic surgeon who \\nwas an active participant in the  planning and execution of the study.  \\nNotifying patients of the  infected surgeon's HIV-status is both disruptive \\nand expensive  and is not routinely recommended, the researchers conclude. \\ \\n       =================================================================     \\n\"Investigation of Potential HIV Transmission to the Patients of  an HIV-\\nInfected Surgeon\" Journal of the American Medical Association (04/14/93) Vol. \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 38\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\n269,  No. 14, P. 1795  (Smith Rogers, Audrey et al.) \\n\\n     The risk of HIV transmission during surgery is so remote that it  will be \\nquantified only by gathering data from multiple,  methodologically similar \\ninvestigations, writes Audrey Smith  Rogers et al. of the Johns Hopkins \\nUniversity School of Medicine  in Baltimore, Md.  The researchers identified a \\ntotal of 1,131  persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical  \\nprocedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the HIV-positive  surgeon was \\nlisted as the operating surgeon.  The AIDS case  registries were reviewed for \\nall patients having undergone  invasive procedures and death certificates were \\nobtained.  Among  the 1,131 patients, 101 were dead, 119 had no address, 413 \\nhad  test results known, and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire. No \\nstudy patient name was found in reported AIDS case registries. One newly \\ndetected, HIV-positive patient was determined to have  been most probably \\ninfected in 1985 during a transfusion.  There  was no HIV transmission in 369 \\nperson-hours of surgical exposure, suggesting that HIV transmission to \\npatients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person-hours \\nof surgical  exposure.  The researchers determined there is no evidence to  \\nsuggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard  infection-control \\nguidelines; over 50 percent of the patients  with invasive procedures chose to \\nbe tested, and of those whose  results were revealed, only one person was \\nfound to be infected  with HIV.  The study patient's infection was probably \\nthe result  of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985.  As a result,  \\nthere is no evidence that the transmission of HIV from the  HIV-positive \\nsurgeon to any patient transpired, the researchers  conclude. \\n      ==================================================================\\n                                April 20, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================\\n \"Drug Concerns to Share AIDS Data\" New York Times (04/20/93), P. C10  \\n(Kolata, Gina) \\n\\n     A total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided, in a  highly \\nunusual move, to share AIDS drugs and information while  the drugs are \\nundergoing early clinical testing.  Dr. Edward  Scolnick, president of the \\nMerck Research Laboratory in Rahway,  N.J., arranged the collaboration.  He \\nsaid that cooperation  between companies seemed increasingly significant as it \\nhad  become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more  effective \\nin fighting HIV than any drug used alone.  The  researchers are hopeful that \\nHIV, when faced with a combination  of several drugs requiring mutation at \\ndifferent sites for  resistance to develop, will be unable to evolve all the \\nmutations at the same time.  Therefore, several drugs taken together or one \\nafter the other could halt the spread of HIV.  Currently, the  drug companies \\ndo not know what other drugs their competitors are developing.  The new \\nagreement allows companies to routinely  exchange animal data and safety data \\non new AIDS drugs.  \"An  agreement like this will greatly facilitate \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 39\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\ncompanies' ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a \\nmuch more  efficient way,\" said Scolnick.  He also said that the  \\ncollaboration would not violate antitrust laws.  In creating the  agreement, \\nMerck spoke frequently to members of AIDS advocacy  groups, including ACT-UP.  \\nDr. Daniel Hoth, director of the  division on AIDS at the National Institute \\nof Allergy and  Infectious Disease said, \"We're delighted to see the  \\npharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that  increasing the \\ninformation flow will likely accelerate the  discovery of better compounds for \\nAIDS.\"  Related Stories: Wall Street Journal (04/20) P.

However, a report in the Lancet demonstrated that AZT should \\nnot be used early in the course of disease.  While the CD4 counts of the 877 \\npeople given AZT were consistently greater  than those of patients receiving \\nonly placebo, the first three  years of follow-up have shown that the \\nproportions of people in  the two groups progressing to overt AIDS or even to \\ndeath were  not significantly different at roughly 18 percent.  The  \\nconclusions are that AZT is not an effective AIDS drug in  HIV-infected \\nindividuals, and that CD4 cell count may not be a  reliable proxy for the \\nprogression to AIDS in infected people.   But nothing is implied by the study \\nof the utility of AZT in the  treatment of those in whom symptoms have already \\nappeared--there  is no case for abandoning that treatment, at least on the  \\nevidence now available.  It is much more alarming that the CD4  count has \\nproven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in HIV \\ninfection.  AIDS researchers should acknowledge  HIV is alive from the \\nbeginning of infection and turn it into a  workable assay of the progress of \\ndisease.  The general  application of such an assay will probably in itself \\nprovide a  better understanding of the pathogenesis of AIDS, concludes  \\nMaddox. \\n      ================================================================== \\n\"Infective and Anti-Infective Properties of Breastmilk From  HIV-1-Infected \\nWomen\" Lancet (04/10/93) Vol. 341, No. 8850, P. 914   (Van de Perre, Philippe \\net al.) \\n\\n     A vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of  the IgM \\ntype in the mother's body fluids could be valuable to  prevent transmission of \\nHIV-1 from mother to child, write  Philippe Van de Perre et al. of the \\n\\nHICNet Medical Newsletter                                              Page 40\\nVolume  6, Number 11                                           April 25, 1993\\n\\nNational AIDS Control Program in Kigali, Rwanda.  The researchers hypothesized \\nthat  transmission of HIV-1 through breastmilk could be favored by the  \\npresence of infected cells, by deficiency of anti-infective  substances in \\nbreastmilk, or both factors.  A total of 215  HIV-1-infected women were \\nenrolled at delivery in Kigali, Rwanda; milk samples were collected 15 days, 6 \\nmonths, and 18 months post partum.  HIV-1 IgG, secretory IgA, and IgM were \\nassayed by  western blot, for the latter two after removal of IgG with  \\nprotein G.  In the 15-day and 6-month samples, the researchers  sought viral \\ngenome in milk cells by double polymerase chain  reaction with three sets of \\nprimers (gag, pol, and env).  At 15  days, 6 months, and 18 months post \\npartum, HIV-1 specific IgG was detected in 95 percent, 98 percent, and 97 \\npercent of breastmilk  samples; IgA in 23 percent, 28 percent, and 41 percent; \\nand IgM  in 66 percent, 78 percent, and 41 percent.  In children who  survived \\nlonger than 18 months the risk of infection was  associated with lack of \\npersistence of IgM and IgA in their  mothers' milk.  The presence of HIV-1-\\ninfected cells in the milk  15 days post partum was strongly predictive of \\nHIV-1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis.  \\nThe  combination of HIV-1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective IgM \\nresponse was the strongest predictor of infection.  IgM and  IgA anti-HIV-1 in \\nbreastmilk may protect against postnatal  transmission of HIV, the researchers \\nconclude. \\n      ==================================================================    \\n                                April 21, 1993 \\n      ==================================================================    \\n\"Firms to Share AIDS Research in Global Venture\" Journal of Commerce \\n(04/21/93), P. 7A \\n\\n     A total of fifteen U.S. and European pharmaceutical companies  announced \\nTuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early-stage AIDS \\nresearch to hasten the search for combination  therapies to fight HIV \\ninfection and AIDS.  The companies said  the unusual move resulted primarily \\nfrom the increasing  concentration of AIDS research on combination therapies \\nsince  realizing that HIV is likely to develop resistance to every  individual \\nAIDS drug.  Edward Scolnick, president of Merck & Co.  Research Laboratories, \\nled the collaborative effort that took a  year of negotiations to come \\ntogether, said participants.  In  addition to Merck, the other companies \\ninvolved in the  Inter-Company Collaboration for AIDS Drug Development are  \\nBristol-Myers Squibb Co., Burroughs Wellcome, Glaxo Inc.,  Hoffman-La Roche, \\nEli Lilly & Co., Pfizer Inc., Smithkline  Beecham, AB Astra, Du Pont Merck, \\nSyntex Inc., Boehringer  Ingelheim, Miles Inc., and Sigma-Tau.  The \\nparticipants said that all companies involved in AIDS drug development they \\nwere aware  of had joined the collaboration, and that any company actively  \\ninvolved in HIV anti-viral development may participate.

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

(If they *understood*\\n  some Wittgenstein, 98% would disappear. :-))\" -- Michael L Siemon\\n\\nSomeone called `boundary\\' wrote:\\n \\n> This quote seems a little arrogant, don\\'t you think?\\n\\nThere is a convention called a `smiley\\', which looks like this:   :-)  .\\nIt is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the\\npreceding comment is supposed to be funny.\\n\\n\\nAnd, I\\'ll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over\\nfive years -- I\\'d say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)\\n\\n *\\n\\nIn the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what\\nI meant by \"There is no way out of the loop\".  I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.  But it\\'s not arrogance for me to tell what\\nI think is the truth.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

I wrote that human brains \"are\\ninfested with sin\", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.\\n\\nIn reply, Mr Boundary wrote:\\n\\n> I would beg to differ with you here.  The properly-formed conscience\\n> can be trusted virtually ALL the time.\\n\\nWhich just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your\\nconscience is properly formed?\\n\\nThe only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the\\nformed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure\\nthat your conscience is `properly formed\\' if you assume that your evaluation\\ncan be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I\\'ll\\ngrant, but it\\'s not a valid way of reasoning.\\n\\nUnless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be\\ncertain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is\\n`properly formed\\'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)\\n\\n\\nMr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:\\n\\n> Now you have hit on the purpose of the Church.  It is by necessity the\\n> infallible interpreter of divine revelation.  Without the Church,          \\n> Christianity would be nothing more than a bunch of little divisive sects.\\n\\nThe Church is `by necessity\\' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?\\nHow do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or\\nanother -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?\\n\\nYou write:\\n\\n> Therefore, although our minds are finite and susceptible to error, our\\n> competence in arriving at inductive insights gives confidence in our\\n> ability to distinguish what is true from what is not true, even in areas\\n> not subject to the experimental method. \\n\\nBut there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to\\ndistinguish what is true from what is not true\\' and `infallible\\'.  I am\\nconfident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way\\nfrom `confident\\'.\\n\\nThis discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain\\n(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is\\nsignificantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that\\nyou are confident, that invites people to ask why.\\n\\nExcept in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely\\ncertain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any\\nidea of his own fallibility.\\n\\n\\nI have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of\\ntruth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of\\nthem -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.\\nThe result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.\\n\\n\\nDarren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu\\n\\n[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the\\noriginal criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster\\nregarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong\\nanswers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal\\nconsequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is\\nat least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that\\n-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are\\nfallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these\\nbasic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it\\'s\\nunlikely that I\\'m misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of\\nconfidence, I\\'ve tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as\\nto sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven\\'t, for\\nexample said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,\\nand I haven\\'t attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a\\nfeeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and\\nintolerant even though I acknowledge that I\\'m fallible and so there\\'s\\nsome chance I\\'m wrong.\\n\\nDon\\'t get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant\\nChristians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least\\nsome cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.\\nIf the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for\\ncertain decisions, it\\'s not my fault -- I\\'m just telling it the way I\\nthink it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that\\nway.  It\\'s one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most\\ndifficult to respond to.

True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin\\n\\n\\ne. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.\\n\\nYour perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.\\n\\nSimilarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.\\n--

Saddam (and Iraq in general) never recognised the \\n  British created Kuwait.  \\n\\nThis is complete garbage.   It is Kuwait FAQ number 1 (maintained, but\\nnot compiled, by me to rebut the leftist drivel frequently posted wrt\\nKuwait): \\n\\n------------------------------------------------------------ \\n\\nFirst is a note on the bogus arguments that the British \\ndrew the maps to deprive Iraq of Oil. Then follows a \\nchronology of events in Kuwait's history.   Following \\nthe chronology is a speech by the Kuwaiti ambassador \\nto the U.N.. Following this is an article on the origins \\nof Kuwait. Following this is a series of articles \\nwhich attest to the fact that Kuwait was independent of both \\n(non-existent) Iraq and the Ottoman Empire. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nThe Iraqi regime claims that Kuwait was cut from Iraq by the British \\nin order to deprive Iraq of its oil. The 1913 and 1932 border treaties \\nbetween Kuwait and Iraq represent clear testimonies against such an \\nallegation since oil was discovered in Kuwait in 1938! \\n\\n--- \\n\\nKuwait: A Chronology \\n\\n[BC 600] The Hellens settled in Al-Khazna Hill area on Failaka \\nIsland. \\n\\n[529] Al-Monzer Bin-Ma'a Al-Sama'a defeated Al-Hareth Al-Kindi in \\nthe Kuwaiti area of Wara. \\n\\n[300] The Greeks lived on Failaka Island for two centuries. \\n\\n[73] A royal message was inscribed on the Ikarus stone which is \\nnow on view in the National Museum of Kuwait. \\n\\n[AD 623] The Arabs defeated the Persians at the battle of Zat \\nAl-Salassel in the Kazima area. \\n\\n[1672] The approximate date of the establishment of Kuwait town \\nwhen Barrak was the Amir of the Beni Khaled tribe. \\n\\n[1711] Approximately when the Al-Sabah family arrived in Kuwait. \\n\\n[1752] The approximate date of the election of Sabah Bin Jaber \\nfrom the Al-Sabah family to be the first ruler of Kuwait. \\n\\n[1760] The first wall, 750 meters long, was built around Kuwait \\nCity. \\n\\n[1762] Abdulla Bin Sabah, the second ruler of Kuwait, came to \\npower. \\n\\n[1765] C. Niebuhr, the Danish traveler, visited Kuwait which he \\nreferred to on his map as ``Grane.'' \\n\\n[1773] Kuwait was attacked by an epidemic  and most of its \\ninhabitants died. \\n\\n[1783] The Kuwaitis defeated the tribe of Bani K'ab in the sea \\nbattle of Riqqa. \\n\\n[1811] The second wall of Kuwait, 2300 meters long, was built. \\n\\n[1871] The Al-Taba'ah accident, in which many Kuwaiti diving \\nships were sunk, was caused by a massive tidal wave between India and \\nMuscat. \\n\\n[1886] The first Kuwaiti currency was minted in copper during the \\nreign of Sheikh Abdulla Al-Sabah II. \\n\\n[1899] Kuwait signs a treaty with Britain and becomes a protectorate. \\n(see note below) \\n\\n[1911] December 22.

The following are quotes of his speech: \\n\\n``Kuwait itself was an entity identified as Kuwait even before \\nIraq was identified as Iraq in the Ottoman Empire. Kuwait was in \\nexistence since 1752. We continued to be in existence until the \\nconflict between the Ottoman Empire and the British and others in the \\narea. Thereafter, we signed with the British in 1899 a protective \\nagreement whereby the British guaranteed the sovereignty and security \\nof Kuwait.'' \\n\\n``In 1913, the British and the Ottoman signed an agreement defining \\nwithout any doubt the borders of Kuwait as they stand today. Such an \\nagreement was reconfirmed in 1932 between the Kuwaiti government \\nand the Iraqi government at that time. That is when Iraq became a state, \\nafter Kuwait itself.'' \\n\\n``In 1961, when we declared our independence Iraq seized the \\nopportunity to claim Kuwait as part of Iraq. There were threats. The \\nBritish came in, and Arab forces came in to guarantee the sovereignty \\nand territorial integrity of Kuwait. In 1963, Kuwait and Iraq again \\nsigned border agreement, thereby defining our territory and Iraq's \\nrecognition to the sovereignty and territory of Kuwait.'' \\n\\n---Compiled by Firyal Alshalalbi \\n\\n\\nOrigins of Kuwait \\n\\nThe establishment of Kuwait is attributed to Barrak b. Ghurair of the \\nBani Khalid who used Kuwait as a summer residence. The beginning of \\nKuwait goes back to the late 17th century and some historians go \\nfurther up to 1611. Kuwait's name is derived from al-Kut which means \\nfortress. Kuwait is also called Qurain, which is the diminutive of qarn, a \\nhorn or hill. Kuwait town flourished and grew since its \\nestablishment. \\n\\nThe 'Utub, al-Sabah family is a branch of 'Utub, settled in Kuwait \\nduring the early 18th century. They lived under the protection \\nof Bani Khalid until 1752. After that, they became independent and \\nSabah Bin Jabir was chosen as the first ruler for 'Utub. \\n\\nCarsten Niebuhr (1733-1815) a Dutch explorer was among the first who \\nwrote about the Arabia. He was the mathematician in the scientific \\nexpedition sent in 1760 by the King of Denmark to Arabia. He \\ndocumented details of Arab tribes inhabiting both coasts of the Gulf \\nand in the case of Kuwait, he was the first writer to give the two \\nnames by which the town was known, Kuwait and Qurain. Niebuhr's chart \\nof the Persian Gulf was the best one drawn before the end of that \\ncentury, see the map from Abu Hakima, History of Eastern Arabia \\n1750-1800. pub.1965. \\n\\nAl-Sabah ('Utub) kept good relations with other powers in the eastern \\nArabia. According to Ahmed Abu Hakima's conclusions in his well \\ndocumented study about the history of eastern Arabia between 1750-1800, \\nthere was no Ottoman rule on the region. ``In the second half of \\nthe 18th century, there was no Ottoman ruler in Eastern Arabia. \\nIn fact, Ottoman rule was not even nominally acknowledged. Their \\nattempts to restore their lost position in al-Hasa through the \\ncampaign of Thuwayni in 1786, and Ali Pasha's expedition against the \\nWahhabis in 1798, were unsuccessful. At Kuwait, the nearest point of \\nthe Utbi domains to the Ottoman Mutasallimiyya of Basra, the Shaikh \\nwas under no form of Ottoman control. The aim of 'Utbi external policy \\nwas to keep on friendly relations with all the forces working in the \\nGulf.'' (p. 182-183) Abu Hakima continued in his conclusions that ``Kuwait \\nwas not a dependency of Basra, the Persian occupation of Basra \\n(1775-79) did not affect Kuwait.'' (p.183) \\n\\nKuwait had its own identity through the Ottoman domination on the Arab \\nworld. This identity was clear to the British and the French who \\ntried to win the support of Kuwait's Sheikh between 1793-95 when the \\nBritish wanted his support in their conflict with the French in the \\nGulf area. \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait \\n\\nThis is the first of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text is related to an expedition carried out by the \\nOttomans in 1871 against the Wahhabis in Eastern Arabia (where the oil fields \\nin Saudi Arabia now). Kuwait and its ruler at that time, Sheikh \\nAbdulla Ibn Sabah Ibn Jabir, allied themselves with the Turks:} \\n\\nAbdullah' role in the fighting was not a minor one. He joined the \\nexpedition as a commander of the large Kuwaiti fleet and was the first \\nto use its guns against the besieged town of Al-Qatif. Had it not been \\nfor this bombardment by the Kuwaiti fleet, Al-Qatif obviously would \\nnot have surrendered in a mere three hours. \\n\\nIn relation to this, a question arises as to why the Ottoman warships \\nrefrained from participating in the bombardment. The answer lies in \\nreports relating to the political movements that preceded accounts of \\nthe progress of the expedition. Because the Ottomans were unwilling to \\njeopardize the maritime peace imposed by Britain in the area,  the \\nSultan and the Pasha promised their warships would not be used in the \\nwar against Su'ud or any Sheikh in the war zone. Kuwait, which was not \\na party  to the above-mentioned treaty of 1861, was under no such \\nobligation especially since the expedition was not directed against \\nthose who had signed it. \\n\\n\\n[ From the above text, we can see that Kuwait was not part of the \\nOttomans or the British colonies. For more details about the mentioned \\nexpedition, please check out the source of the above text: \\n\\nThe Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, McGill \\nUniversity, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--2 \\n\\nThis is another article of a series of articles that testify to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\nThe following text discusses a dispute on an estate called Sufiyya in Zubair, \\nIraq, between the Sheikh of Kuwait and Al-Zuhair tribe in Zubair. \\n\\nIn 1866, trouble developed over the possession by Sheikh Sabah of the \\nestate which was [purchased] by his father, Sheikh Jabir, in 1836. This \\nproperty was sequestered by a Turkish Qa'immaqam [representative] on \\nthe basis of a claim by the Al-Zuhair that the vendor had been the \\nowner of a share and not of the n 100e Sufiyya. At the same time, \\nSheikh Sabah was required to expel from other lands owned by him at \\nthe island of Fao some cultivators who had immigrated from Persian \\nterritory. \\n\\nIt should be recalled that  the Turkish officials from the start \\nshowed strong prejudice in favor of the Zuhair claimants. Abdulla Ibn \\nSabah,  the eldest son of the ruler of Kuwait who went to Basra as his \\nfather's agent in the case,  narrowly escaped being thrown  into jail \\nupon his refusal to make a payment amounting to the value of seven \\nyears produce which the Ottoman authorities deemed the plaintiffs were \\nentitled to receive. \\n\\nEventually, the dispute was settled by the Wali [Governor] of Baghdad \\nin favor of the Sheikh of Kuwait. The decision of the Governor of \\nBasra in favor of the Sheikh was apparently made for various reasons. \\nSome writers think that the Governor wanted to win Abdulla over to the \\nTurkish side, and suggest that the Governor, Namiq Pasha, even offered \\nhim the title of Qa'immaqam, which he declined. Nevertheless,  the \\nproceedings of the Turks in this case were regarded by the inhabitants \\nof Kuwait as attempts to cause a confrontation with Zubair. It seems \\nthat they had anticipated a conflict and according to reports by the \\nBritish Agent at Basra, the people of Kuwait were prepared to a man to \\nabandon their town rather than submit to Turkish rule. Lorimer suggests \\nthat the final order of Namiq Pasha, upholding the Kuwait Sheikh's \\ntitle to Sufiyya, was perhaps due to a report that Sheikh Sabah, \\n``with the object of attacking Zubair if the decision should go \\nagainst him, had obtained a promise of countenance and armed support \\nfrom the Wahhabi Amir.'' \\n\\nIn addition to this legal matter with Zubair, Kuwait had had other \\nproblems with Basra whose courts tried to jail Abdulla Ibn Sabah, as \\nexplained above. However, Kuwait's relations with the Ottoman \\nmutasallims of Basra had at times been amicable and in several \\ninstances, those mutasallims even sought refuge at Kuwait when \\npressured by the Pashas of Baghdad who exercised control over them. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--3 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nWhen Pelly [Colonel Pelly, the British Resident in the Gulf] visited Kuwait \\nfor the first time on March 3, 1863, he was \\nmet at Jahra by Sheikh Mubarak, the second son of the ruler, Sheikh \\nSabah. Just before he reached Kuwait town on March 4, he was met by \\nSheikh Abdulla, the eldest son and heir apparent, who accompanied him \\nto the town gate on their way to ``a very good home,'' which had been \\nprepared for Pelly and his companions. ``Scarcely had we entered it,'' \\nsays Pelly, ``when Sheikh Sabah himself came.'' \\nThis description of Pelly's reception indicates that to a certain \\ndegree it was run according to protocol. \\n\\nThe government system of Kuwait and administration of justice were the \\nsubject of comments made by Pelly. ``The Government is patriarchal,'' \\nsays Pelly, ``the Sheikh managing the political, and the Cazee [Qadi] \\nthe judicial departments. The Sheikh himself would submit to the \\nCazee's decision.'' Punishment was rarely inflicted. ``Indeed, there \\nseems little government interference anywhere, and little need of an \\narmy.'' Pelly in admiration of how the Sheikh ran the affairs of the \\ncountry, retold the following remark which the Sheikh had made to him: \\n\\nWhen my father was nearly 120 years old, he called me and said, ``I \\nshall soon die. I have made no fortune, and can leave you no money, \\nbut I have made many and true friends, grapple them. While other \\nstates around the Gulf have fallen off from injustice or \\nill-government, mine has gone on [flourishing]. Hold to my policy, and \\nthough you are surrounded by  desert, and pressed by a once hostile \\nand still wandering set of tribes, you will prosper.'' \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\nIndependent Kuwait--4 \\n\\nThis is another article that testifies to the \\nindependence of Kuwait throughout its history from both Iraq and the \\nOttomans. \\n\\n\\nThe British had always regarded Sheikh Jabir as a ``good friend,'' but \\nin October 1839, an event took place at Kuwait which could have \\nweakened those good relations. On October 30, Lieutenant Edmunds, the \\nAssistant Resident at Abu Shahr [in Iran], arrived in Kuwait on  a \\nspecial mission from the Resident, Captain Hennell. His mission was to \\nfind out if Kuwait was willing to welcome the establishment of a \\nBritish line of post across the desert from Kuwait to the \\nMediterranean. The British war vessel fired the usual salute in honor \\nof the Sheikh after it had anchored in the waters of Kuwait Bay. The \\nsalute was not acknowledged and Edmunds waited in the vessel for three \\ndays before he was able to communicate with the Sheikh. \\n\\nAfter Edmunds' return to Abu Shahr, both he and Captain Hennell \\nexplained this unusual behavior of the Sheikh, to have been due not \\nto ill-will, but principally to a desire to mislead the Egyptian agent \\nat Kuwait as to the nature of his relations with the British. \\nTherefore, they considered that Jabir's conduct did not indicate any \\nchange in his friendly policies towards the British. \\n\\nIf the British tolerated the attitude of Jabir towards Edmunds, so \\nalso did the Egyptians. Earlier in the same year, some of the most \\nwanted men in the Wahhabi camp, such as 'Umar Ibn 'Ufaisan, the \\nWahhabi general  in Al-Hasa, and Wahhabi tribes like Al-Duwaish, \\nsought refuge in Kuwait. \\n\\nProtection of refugees seeking political \\nasylum in his country was a policy that had been adopted earlier by \\nSheikh Abdulla Ibn Sabah. This can, therefore, be looked upon as an \\nindication of self-confidence; an outcome of Kuwait's independence \\nfrom foreign powers. It corroborates the fact that Kuwait, if \\nnecessary, was prepared to defend itself against more powerful \\nneighbors. \\n\\nThis defense depended not only on the walls of the city, but also on \\nbedouin tribes in its neighborhood and a merchant fleet equipped with \\nthe necessary guns comparable to other Arab fleets of the time. \\n\\nAs to Kuwait's position between 1815 and 1839, one can safely state \\nthat it managed to maintain a neutral policy with regard to the \\nstruggling Wahhabis and Egyptians. Relations with the British  and \\neven with the Pasha of Baghdad continued on good terms. \\n\\n[ Source: The Modern History of Kuwait, 1750--1965, by Ahmed Abu-Hakima, \\nMcGill University, Canada ] \\n\\n--- \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  They were trying to recover land they believed \\n  was theirs, much like the Argentines in the Faulklands.

I have been told that it is some sort of C.Itoh printer in disguise. Can anyone help with manuals or info about codes to send to select fonts, italics etc. I want to write a printer driver for Protext.\\n\\nThanks in
